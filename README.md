# Termite Clone (with Qt/QML and C++)

This is a clone of the [Termite](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm) terminal emulator, written in Qt/QML and C++.
This project is a practice project for me to learn Qt/QML and C++.
But I hope it can be useful for someone else.

The application is still in development, but it is already usable.

### This is a screenshot of the application:
